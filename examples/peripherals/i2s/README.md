# Simple ESP-IDF WAV Audio Player

I spent waaaaaaay too much time trying to get ESP-IDF to play a wav file to an external DAC using I2S.

The biggest problem I had was there was no working example of doing exactly this in its simplest form. Most examples are Arduino based, ESP-ADF based, or rely on the legacy ESP-IDF <=4.x APIs. I'm usig ESP-IDF 5.x with my project and I don't have a need for any of the ESP-ADF tools or fancy player pipelines. I just wanted a bare bones example of streaming a WAV file from the SD card to the DAC so that I could better understand the protocols and apis.

I hope by sharing this simple project, others in my position can benefit by seeing a working example and expand on it as I did.

_Note: this project plays a single WAV file encoded in 44.1kHz 16bit stereo off of the SD card and then reboots_

**This uses the ESP-IDF V5 apis and will not work on older IDF versions!**

## How to use example

Clone this repo and make sure your path settings are correct for your local ESP-IDF installation. _ref a working project .vscode directory ;-)_

Run menuconfig and set the chip and what not. _I did this all with an ESP32-WROVER-E series module_

Open [configuration.h](main/configuration.h) and make sure you adjust the pin defines to your setup.

Run Build, Flash, monitor :)

### Hardware setup

The setup I'm using for this example is an ESP32-WROVER-E-N8R8 module on a custom board connected to a PCM5102a DAC chip.

### Connections

SD is a microSD card connected to the default SDMMC (4bit) pins from the datasheet. (Pin config is found in the [configuration.h](main/configuration.h) file.)
All the pins are pulled up to 3.3v using 10k resistors (SD spec calls for 10K but the Espressif datasheet calls for 1K.. 10K works just fine)

The PCM5102a DAC is connected using the Bit clock, Word clock, and Data in pins.
These can be arbitrary pins as there is no "dedicated I2S bus" pins on the ESP32.

- Bit clock is connected to GPIO pin 5
- Word clock is connected to GPIO pin 19
- Data Out is connected to GPIO pin 23

| ESP32S3 |  |PCM5102a | |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------- | -------- |
| GPIO 38 | I2S_BLK_PIN     | Bit Clock | BCK |
| GPIO 41 | I2S_WS_PIN      | Word Clock | LRCK/LCK |
| GPIO 40 | I2S_DATA_OUT_PIN | Data Out | DIN |

_again you can change this in [configuration.h](main/configuration.h)_

### WAV File settings

**This example only support 44.1kHz 16bit Stereo WAV files. Beyond that, you're on your own.**

## Folder contents

The project **esp-idf-wav-player** is a C based project with `app_main` found in [main.c](main/main.c). The file is located in folder [main](main).

There are a couple header files to move some boiler plate out of the main file to keep the project a bit easier to read.

The [configuration.h](main/configuration.h) file contains general configuration items like pin configuration definitions as well as a helper to print out system information.

The [sdcard.h](main/sdcard.h) file contains the logic required to initialize an SDMMC peripheral as well as a helper function to log data about the card.

ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt`
files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets
(executable, library, or both).

Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.
